# Node CRUD

CRUD using Node and express for DeVinci Junior

## Run the project

First clone the project, then install the packages using
```
npm install
```

Then start the serveur
```
node serveur.js
```

**Don't forget to create a .env file and add your environment variables like in .env.example**<br>
When the api is launch, you can execute the index.html file in the public folder

The api can also be available on 92.222.217.140:3000 (maybe I will stop the host one day)
